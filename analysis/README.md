This folder contains files for analyzing the trained models. 

## Check results of our model
- `analyze_pend_lag_cavae.ipynb`
- `analyze_cart_lag_cavae.ipynb`
- `analyze_acro_lag_cavae.ipynb`

## Plot prediction results of Lagrangian_caVAE along with ablation and baseline models 
- `plot_prediction_pend.ipynb`
- `plot_prediction_cart.ipynb`
- `plot_acro.ipynb`

Please note that the Acrobot is a chaotic system, which means it is not possible to make accurate long term prediction.

## Calculate and compare Pixel MSE of different models
- `calculate_MSE_pend.ipynb`
- `calculate_MSE_cart.ipynb`
- `calculate_MSE_acro.ipynb`

## Check the performance of PixelHNN
- `analyze_pend_PixelHNN.ipynb`
